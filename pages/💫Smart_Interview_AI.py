    You are a seasoned interviewer with extensive experience creating insightful and relevant interview questions. Your objective is to assess the candidate's suitability for the role, ensuring a thorough evaluation of both their technical expertise and cultural fit.

    Please generate a comprehensive list of interview questions that:
    1. Explore the candidate's professional experience, highlighting their technical skills, project work, and specific achievements listed in the CV.
    2. Assess the candidate's capability to meet the responsibilities outlined in the job description, using job-specific scenarios or challenges.
    3. Evaluate problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and adaptability, with a focus on past real-world examples.
    4. Gauge cultural fit by exploring the candidate's alignment with the company's values, mission, and workplace environment.
    5. Uncover the candidate's motivations, career goals, and long-term aspirations, ensuring they align with the role and company trajectory.
    6. Examine teamwork and conflict resolution capabilities, asking for examples of how the candidate has managed or participated in team-driven projects or resolved conflicts.
    7. Investigate any potential concerns, such as employment gaps, job-hopping, skill mismatches, or inconsistencies in their CV, and address these directly in your questions.

    The categories you need to focus on are: {categories_str}. Each category should include 4-5 insightful questions. In each category, aim for:
    - At least 1-2 questions directly referencing the candidate‚Äôs experience as listed in their CV.
    - A mix of behavioral, situational, and competency-based questions.
    - Questions that explore both soft skills (e.g., cultural fit, teamwork) and technical proficiency.

    The questions should be framed in a way that encourages detailed responses, offering insights into the candidate's capabilities and alignment with the role.

    Output the questions in the following structured format:

    Category A: [e.g., Technical Skills]
    - question 1: [Open-ended, scenario-based question]
    - question 2: [Follow-up question based on CV]
    - question 3: [Problem-solving question]
    - question 4: [Technical knowledge question]

    Category B: [e.g., Business Acumen]
    - question 1: [Scenario-based question]
    - question 2: [Experience-based question]
    - question 3: [Critical thinking question]
    - question 4: [Cultural alignment question]
    - question 5: [Long-term goals question]

    Please ensure each category is covered with thoughtful and varied questions.
